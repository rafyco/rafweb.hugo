A Polish philosopher once ruled that the sun stands still and all the other planets revolve around it. Contrary to the
common belief of the time that the sun is centrally located, he managed to convince the whole world of the validity
of his views and won international fame.

However, this fact was not accepted for a long time, and a long time had to pass before this happened. Many scientists
could not afford to change the way they thought about the appearance of the cosmos at the time especially having many
scientific works based on geocentrism.

It is noteworthy that both the geocentric and the later heliocentric models are only approximations of how the planets
interact, yet both work well in today's applications.

In reality, the movements of the planets are much more complicated by which the only method of estimating approximate
positions are computer models.

Nevertheless, these problems have provoked many philosophical discussions and deliberations, and their contribution
to today's science is invaluable. They show us how limited the human mind is and how many ways everyday phenomena
can be considered.

In this blog you will have the opportunity to look at various philosophical and social problems from different angles,
and a different point of view will give you insight into interesting issues you have not paid attention to before.

I invite you to post in the comments ideas for topics that you find interesting and could be an interesting continuation
of the series. I also invite you to follow the blog. There will soon be additional information on how you can get
information about new posts in an easy and fun way.

You are cordially invited
