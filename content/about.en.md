# Hello World👋

I am a fullstack software engineer from Warsaw, Poland

Programmer, music and technology lover. In my free time I like to sink
myself in the vapors of absurdity, while creating my creations and taking the world
to a new level of abstraction. When the creative urge leaves me, I give myself over to
designing software.

And when all else fails, I put on my cape and save the world from
evil... Decide for yourself if I haven't made up something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * 🔭 I work as a fullstack engineer with the [React](https://react.dev) framework.
 * 📟 In my spare time I slap together mobile apps using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
 * 👧 Privately a father of little Pola.
 * 🌱 I'm constantly learning.
